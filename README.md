# Front End Web Development Techdegree - Project 4

I am attempting to meet the "Exceeds Expectations" requirements for this project.  If my project doesn't meet the "Exceeds Expectations" requirements, please reject it as "needing additional work."

- Project files placed in GitHub repository.

- Project Folders, Variables, and Mixins:
  - The entire sass project is in a folder named “scss.”
  - Variables, mixins, and placeholders are in a “utilities” sub-folder.
    - At least one variable has been created for each of the following: fonts, breakpoints, colors.
    - A mixin is created for Media Queries and used used for all media queries.
    - A mixin is created for Flexbox settings and used for all flexbox declarations.
  - Classes for styling the page are in a “components” sub-folder.
  - The normalize.css file and element styles are in a “base” sub-folder.
  - Subfolders are imported into styles.scss file in correct order.

- Design
  - index.html matches overall design of mobile and desktop mockup files.  
  - no_classes.html matches appearance of no_classes_mockup.png file.
  - index.html file has not been changed.

Validation:
  - HTML validated for index.html with accepted exceptions:
    - There was one error foudn by the HTML checker: "Line 106 - Element legend not allowed as child of element form in this context." Since we were instructed to not revise index.html, I did not fix this error!!!
  - CSS validated for styles.css with accepted exceptions.
  - I checked the pages in Opera, Chrome, and Firefox - everything appears to work.
